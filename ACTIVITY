Donovian Post Exploitation (DPE)
XX Mar 2024
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective: Maneuver through Donovian-Extranet, identify and gain access futher into Donovian internal Cyberspace, it is believed that there is an network that acts as an internal DMZ between these to locations. Intelligence was able to identify the last octet of a system that resides in the Donovian internal Cyberspace.

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through SSH masquerades or web browser. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. Network scanning tools/technique usage is at the discretion of student. Credential reuse is authorized

Scenario Credentials: FLAG = P05T3xpl01t5t@rtoF@ct1v1ty

Prior Approvals: Sudo usage and remote port forward is authorized. System dir walks from system roots, altering accounts/routing or tool uploads are authorized. Survey and access to newly discovered systems during C-ISR.

Donovian Linux Privilege Escalation, and Persistence (DLP)
XX Feb 2027
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Cyberspace Exploitation (C-E)

Objective: Maneuver into the Donovian internal network, gain privileged access to discovered Linux hosts.

Tools/Techniques: SSH masquerade into internal network with provided credentials. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. Linux techniques to gain privileged access and persist are limited to host misconfigurations, open suid/sgid, weak permissions, and path. Network scanning tools/technique usage is at the discretion of student.

 Gorgas Reverse Engineering (GRE)
XX Sep 2025
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: DEVOPS

Objective: Intel has identified that the Donovian_Webserver (192.168.28.111) is hosting binaries via port 80 at the following URI /longTermStorage. We have been tasked with pulling the binaries back into blue space to conduct Reverse Enineering operations. Conduct Reverse Engineering (disassemble, debug) on collected files, determine functionality and methods to successfully execute files.

Tools/Techniques: Ghidra, IDA, and GDB.

Scenario Credentials: FLAG = R3V3R535t@rt0F@ct1v1ty

Prior Approvals:All files can be extracted from the known target "Donovian-Webserver". Only authorized to conduct task on Analyst Workstations.

T1
Hostname: web.site.donovia
IP: 192.168.28.111
OS: unknown
Creds: comrade::StudentWebExploitPassword
Last Known SSH Port: unknown
PSP: Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Action: Extract approved binaries under directory titled "longTermStorage".


Situation:
Various teams have extracted binaries from Donovian development networks. Analyze the given binaries to find weaknesses and create signatures.

Provided:
compiled executable: (entry.exe)
source code: (entry.c)
Task: Run the executable with expected input and retrieve success message.
Method: disassemble the executable and follow the program’s execution to discover its functionality, and expected input.

Ensure that before you move on from this challenge that you have fully understood what you have done to disassemble and reverse engineer this binary and how it is related to the provided source code.

What is the key for this binary?
