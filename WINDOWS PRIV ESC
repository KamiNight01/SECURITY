DLL Search Order
Executables check the following locations (in successive order):

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs
The directory the the Application was run from
The directory specified in in the C+ function GetSystemDirectory()
The directory specified in the C+ function GetWindowsDirectory()
The current directory


DLL Search Order
DLL Hijacking is a technique in which an attacker abuses Window’s Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) Search Order to trick a program into running a custom DLL that executes malicious code.
Dynamic-Link Libraries are libraries of additional functions for a program. They allow for a programmer to not have to recreate commonly used functions by making a program call them. The following steps are used to search for DLL’s when called by a program.
The program checks the following registry location and will attempt to use the last known location of the DLL
reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs"
If the DLL is not found the program will check the following locations, in order:
The directory the the Application was run from
The exact location on the hard drive where the program was executed from. Even locations such as C:\Users\Public\Downloads
The directory specified in in the C+ function GetSystemDirectory()
The returned location is C:\Windows\system32 even on 64 bit systems.
The directory specified in the C+ function GetWindowsDirectory()
The returned location should always be C:\Windows
The current directory
The current directory assuming the application was executed using its full path.


LAST KNOWN DLL LOCATION
reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs"
